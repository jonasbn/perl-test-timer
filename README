NAME
    Test::Timer - a test module to test/assert response times

VERSION
    The documentation in this module describes version 0.05 of Test::Timer

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::Timer;
    
        time_ok( sub { doYourStuffButBeQuickAboutIt(); }, 1, 'threshold of one second');

        time_atmost( sub { doYourStuffYouHave10Seconds(); }, 10, 'threshold of 10 seconds');

        time_between( sub { doYourStuffYouHave5-10Seconds(); }, 5, 10,
            'lower threshold of 5 seconds and upper threshold of 10 seconds');

        #Will succeed
        time_nok( sub { sleep(2); }, 1, 'threshold of one second');
    
        time_atleast( sub { sleep(2); }, 2, 'threshold of one second');
    
        #Will fail after 5 (threshold) + 2 seconds (default alarm)
        time_ok( sub { while(1) { sleep(1); } }, 5, 'threshold of one second');

        $test::Timer::alarm = 6 #default 2 seconds

        #Will fail after 5 (threshold) + 6 seconds (specified alarm)
        time_ok( sub { while(1) { sleep(1); } }, 5, 'threshold of one second');

DESCRIPTION
    Test::Timer implements a set of test primitives to test and assert test
    times from bodies of code. The code is currently at the alpha stage and
    might change in the future.

EXPORT
    Test::Timer exports:

    time_ok, time_nok, time_atleast, time_atmost and time_between

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  time_ok
    Takes the following parameters:

    *   a reference to a block of code (anonymous sub)

    *   a threshold specified as a integer indicating a number of seconds

    *   a string specifying a test name

        time_ok( sub { doYourStuffButBeQuickAboutIt(); }, 1, 'threshold of one second');

    If the execution of the code exceeds the threshold the test fails

  time_nok
    The is the inverted variant of "time_ok", it passes if the threshold is
    exceeded and fails if the benchmark of the code is within the specified
    threshold.

    The API is the same as for "time_ok".

        time_nok( sub { sleep(2); }, 1, 'threshold of one second');

  time_atmost
    This is syntactic sugar for "time_ok"

        time_atmost( sub { doYourStuffButBeQuickAboutIt(); }, 1, 'threshold of one second');

  time_atleast
        time_atleast( sub { sleep(2); }, 1, 'threshold of one second');

    The test succeeds if the code takes at least the number of seconds
    specified by the threshold.

    Please be aware that Test::Timer, breaks the execution with an alarm
    specified to trigger after the specified threshold + 2 seconds, so if
    you expect your execution to run longer, set the alarm accordingly.

        $Test::Timer::alarm = $my_alarm_in_seconds;

    See also diagnostics.

  time_between
    This method is a more extensive variant of "time_atmost" and "time_ok",
    you can specify a lower and upper threshold, the code has to execute
    within this interval in order for the test to succeed

        time_between( sub { sleep(2); }, 5, 10,
            'lower threshold of 5 seconds and upper threshold of 10 seconds');

PRIVATE FUNCTIONS
  _runtest
    This is a method to handle the result from "_benchmark" is initiates the
    benchmark calling benchmark and based on whether it is within the
    provided interval true (1) is returned and if not false (0).

  _runtest_atleast
    This is a simpler variant of the method above, it is the author's hope
    that is can be refactored out at some point, due to the similarity with
    "_runtest".

  _benchmark
    This is the method doing the actual benchmark, if a better method is
    located this is the place to do the handy work.

    Currently Benchmark is used. An alternative could be Devel::Timer, but I
    do not know this module very well and Benchmark is core, so this is used
    for know.

    The method takes two parameters:

    *   a code block via a code reference

    *   a threshold (the upper threshold, since this is added to the default
        alarm.

  _timestring2time
    This is the method extracts the seconds from benchmarks timestring and
    returns it and an integer.

    It takes the timestring from "_benchmark"/Benchmark and returns the
    seconds part.

  import
    Test::Builder required import to do some import hokus-pokus for the test
    methods exported from Test::Timer. Please refer to the documentation in
    Test::Builder

DIAGNOSTICS
    All tests either fail or succeed, but a few exceptions are implemented,
    these are listed below.

    *   Test did not exceed specified threshold, this message is diagnosis
        for "time_atleast" and "time_nok" tests, which do not exceed their
        specified threshold.

    *   Test exceeded specified threshold, this message is a diagnostic for
        "time_atmost" and "time_ok", if the specified threshold is
        surpassed.

        This is the key point of the module, either your code is too slow
        and you should address this or your threshold is too low, in which
        case you can set it a bit higher and run the test again.

    *   Test did not execute within specified interval, this is the
        diagnostic from "time_between", it is the diagnosis if the execution
        of the code is not between the specified lower and upper thresholds.

    *   Insufficient parameters, this is the message if a specified test is
        not provided with the sufficent number of parameters, consult this
        documentation and correct accordingly.

    *   Execution exceeded threshold and timed out, the exception is thrown
        if the execution of tested code exceeds even the alarm, which is
        default 2 seconds, but can be set by the user or is equal to the
        uppertreshold + 2 seconds.

        The exception results in a diagnostic for the failing test. This is
        a failsafe to avoid that code runs forever. If you get this diagnose
        either your code is too slow and you should address this or it might
        be error prone. If this is not the case adjust the alarm setting to
        suit your situation.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
    This class holds no known incompatibilities.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    This class holds no known bugs.

    As listed on the TODO, the current implementations only use seconds and
    resolutions should be higher.

TEST AND QUALITY
    The test suite currently covers 94.5% (release 0.02)

    The Test::Perl::Critic test runs with severity 5 (gentle) for now,
    please refer to t/critic.t and t/perlcriticrc

    Set TEST_POD to enable Test::Pod test in t/pod.t and Test::Pod::Coverage
    test in t/pod-coverage.t

    Set TEST_AUTHOR to enable Test::Perl::Critic test in t/critic.t

TODO
    *   Implement higher resolution for thresholds

    *   Factor out "_runtest_atleast"

    *   Add more tests to get a better feeling for the use and border cases
        requiring alarm etc.

    *   Rewrite POD to emphasize "time_atleast" over "time_ok"

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Gabor Szabo (GZABO), suggestion for specification of interval thresholds
    even though this was obsoleted by the later introduced time_between
    Paul Leonerd Evans (PEVANS), suggestions for time_atleast and
    time_atmost and the handling of $SIG{ALRM}.
        = brian d foy (BDFOY), for patch to "_run_test"

DEVELOPMENT
    This module is very much alpha stage, so pacthes and suggestions are
    more that welcome, I also think there are some pitfalls and caveats I
    have not yet seen.

    So feedback/patches is more than welcome.
