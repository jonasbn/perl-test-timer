- Changed some test parameters was made a bit less relaxed attempting to decrease the execution time
  for the test suite

2.08 2017-11-20 Maintenance release, update not required

- Addressing reports on failing tests from CPAN testers


2.07 2017-11-18 Maintenance release, update not required

- Addressing issue #17, the tests are now more liberal, so when executed
  on smokers, CI environments and similar, load will not influence the
  test results. The requirement for Test::Tester has been updated and a patch
  required by this distribution has been included


2.06 2017-11-14 Maintenance release, update not required

- Added cancellation of alarm, based on advice from Erik Johansen

- Implemented own sleep, based on select, this might address possible issues with
  sleep implementations

- Addressed issue #11 adding experimental graphical support elements to the documentation


2.04 2017-10-15 Maintenance release, update not required

- Minor improvements to Test::Timer::TimeoutException, some obsoleted code could
  be removed

- Generalising test asserting, since CPAN testers are sometime constrained on resources,
  making it impossible to predict the actual timeout value

  Example: http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/2561e32c-9efa-11e7-bc90-bbe42ddde1fb

- Correction of spelling mistake in PR #16 from Gregor Herrmann of the Debian Perl Group

1.00 2017-06-03 Feature release, update recommended

- Implemented suggestion for improvement from Nigel Horne (#10)
  https://github.com/jonasbn/perl-test-timer/issues/10

  the relevant specified thresholds

  are explicitly specified

- Exchanged CJMÂ´s:
  https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::VersionFromModule
